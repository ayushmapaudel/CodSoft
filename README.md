# Titanic Survival Analysis ðŸš¢

This project analyzes survival patterns on the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, and NumPy.  
I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and basic modeling to understand the factors affecting survival chances.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn (for EDA visuals)

## Project Highlights
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing on the Titanic dataset, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights about passenger demographics and survival rates.
- Created visualizations to analyze relationships between features such as Age, Fare, Passenger Class, and Survival outcomes.
- Prepared the dataset for potential further analysis or machine learning applications.


## Dataset
